# CuartaMark
THE BLACK FRIDAY
An online website called “CuartaMarkt.com” sells popular cellphones. As an strategy 
to increase the sales on the Black Friday the website has decided to offer 10
cellphones at an amazing random discount between 30% - 40%.

These are the cellphones which will be offered to the customers that day:
- “Aifon X”. Original price: 1000 €
- “Juan-wei Mate Profesional”. Original price: 925 €
- “Shang Tsung S9”. Original price: 975 €

Customers will have the chance to buy one cellphone if they are lucky. They will not
know the price of the item until they have paid the price, but they want to buy it
because the discount is very attractive.
The sales responsible prepares three different types of offers: "Aifon X", "Juan-wei
Mate Profesional", "Shang Tsung S9". Each offer has a random discount between
30% - 40%. When an offer is prepared it is placed on the website which will allow
the customers to buy it. The sales responsible needs a random time between 0,5
and 1 seconds to create an offer and upload it on the website.
It is requested to write the code that simulates the behavior of the operation of the
website.
